NodePong is a browser-based multi-player implementation of the classic arcade game Pong. My goal is to write a very simple game playable on desktop and mobile devices, with enough features to keep it interesting. It uses:

node.js for non-blocking server code
socket.io for websocket integration
jQuery for dynamic browser interaction
jQuery touch for mobile touch support

To function, this app requires that node.js be installed, as well as the node module socket.io, using npm (node package manager).

This repository is a work in progress, and may not function from day to day. I'll list stable versions below. Additionally, the components are all non-proprietary open standards, and continually in flux.

This is my first attempt at a network game, and my first foray back into both JavaScript and game construction in a long time. I'll try to keep things well-commented to guide those who are interested in following along, and eventually I hope to write a clear set of tutorials explaining what I've done and how I've done it, so other interested parties can avoid the problems I encountered and make cooler things faster.
