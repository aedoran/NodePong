NodePong is a browser-based multi-player implementation of the classic arcade game Pong. My goal is to write a very simple game playable on desktop and mobile devices, with enough features to keep it interesting. It uses:

node.js for non-blocking server code
socket.io for websocket integration
jQuery for dynamic browser interaction
jQuery touch for mobile touch support

This repository is a work in progress, and may not function from day to day. I'll list stable versions below. Additionally, the components are all non-proprietary open standards, and continually in flux.

This is my first attempt at a network game, and my first foray back into both javaScript and game construction in a long time. I'll try to keep things well-commented to guide those who are interested in following along, and eventually I hope to write a clear set of tutorials explaining what I'm up to, so other interested parties can avoid the same problems I encountered.

Ping,
Peter Richardson
